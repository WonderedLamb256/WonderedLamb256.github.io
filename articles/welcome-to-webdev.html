                        <h1>Lamb's Web Developing Guide pt. 1: Intro to HTML+CSS</h1>
                        <p>
                              Welcome to the <em>wonderful</em> world of web development!<br/>
                              Web development is a fun and relaxing task. However, before you begin to make web pages, you'll
                              need to know how to. <em>&ldquo;But how?&rdquo;</em>, you say. That's exactly what you'll be learning
                              today. I'd like to begin with explaining all of the web development languages so you're familiar with them.
                        </p>
                        <h2>Web Development Languages</h2>
                        <p>
                              Web development comes in many different forms - HTML, CSS, JavaScript... I'll give you a short
                              and simple explanation for all of those languages. P.S. a backend language is server side, a frontend language is client side.
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                              <li><p>HTML - The skeleton of the web. Without HTML, you'd only have primordial websites that use backend languages or JavaScript to write.</p></li>
                              <li><p>XML - Another markup class language used mainly for SEO and configuration today.</p></li>
                              <li><p>CSS - The muscles of the web. This makes a website look advanced. Sometimes used with preprocessors like Sass or LESS or with frameworks like Bootstrap.</p></li>
                              <li><p>Sass/SCSS or LESS - CSS with a brain, aka CSS with functions, mixins and other neat things.</p></li>
                              <li><p>JavaScript - The brain of the web. Can be improved with libraries like jQuery, and has many features of a typical programming language
                                .</p></li>
                              <li><p>PHP - The remaining internal organs of the web. Useful for transferring data to servers and can work like JavaScript.</p></li>
                              <li><p>Rust and C++ - Wait, what!? Huh!? WebAssembly!? What!?</p></li>
                              <li><p>Python - Not exclusive to web development, but Django and Flask are frequently used as web server frameworks.</p></li>
                              <li><p>SQL - Structured Query Language. Is useful for putting data in databases.</p></li>
                              <li><p>NoSQL - *ahem* Well... NOT Structured Query Language.</p></li>
                              <li><p>Java - Java applets and Spring. That's pretty much all.</p></li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                              Now that we've gotten that out of the way,
                        </p>
